            Bobik's Island is believed to be incomplete as it may have used custom assets.

            <h1>Found (but unuploaded) Works</h1>
            ZumaLuxor is currently not available. He modified the Zuma Deluxe trial EXE itself and
            <i>included a keygen</i> in the download - he also used an installer for it. While a future
            download may appear as a "pre-installed" package without the keygen, I'm still on the fence
            about it due to the fact that the EXE had to be edited for string edits to work. The EXE
            included is a trial of Zuma Deluxe, although there are many versions of the game available.
            A download of ZumaLuxor without the required files to run may be available in the future, but
            it won't have the EXE edits.
