            <h1>Who is Bobik?</h1>
            <p>
                Bobik was an Internet user who was active around 2015 to late 2016, and was also known as lackj.
                He disappeared around late 2016 and was never heard of from since.
                <br><br>
                He was a Senior Member in the Piste Gamez forum, and the founder of Sphere Matchers. He made
                custom episodes for Pekka Kana 2 and several mods for Luxor and Luxor Amun Rising.
            </p>

            <h1>Why archive this man's work?</h1>
            <p>
                Long story short, community archival & media preservation is important.
                <br><br>
                When a member of an online community leaves the Internet for good, chances are the links that they
                leave out on the Internet eventually become dead links. These links may have been custom levels
                for a game, images for a tutorial, so on and so forth. This especially goes true for forums, where
                posts are added and edited over time and who knows who has been feeding them to the Internet Archive
                (Dropbox links are also exempted from archival). Most likely nobody - and even so, only the homepage
                and maybe a couple of important threads have been archived. It's also hard (atleast, I think) to
                archive download links to Internet Archive - what purpose is there when you can download and reupload
                the file?
                <br><br>
                And speaking of Dropbox, guess where he uploaded most of his files. That's right - Dropbox.
                <a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Security-and-Permissions/Inactive-account/td-p/528626">
                Dropbox automatically deletes your account if it has been inactive for a year.</a>
                Good luck trying to fetch somebody's files once they see the other side.
                <br><br>
                He also had some Google Drive links, but from September 2021 <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10729743?hl=en#zippy=">
                Google Drive had a security update that requires new file access requests to be requested.</a>
                People who have opened the file at least once in Google Drive can still access them as is, but
                new requests from people who haven't done so will require access. This also hampers not
                only work from this person, but many other works of inactive accounts.
            </p>

            <h1>Okay, but why a site dedicated to this person?</h1>
            <p>
                Treat this as an index of sorts with an easy-to-remember link.
            </p>

            <h1>Can he still be contacted to this day?</h1>
            <p>
                No. Attempts to E-mail him have been made and no replies were received.
            </p>

            <h1>My community is also in a similar situation - can I make an archive like yours?</h1>
            <p>
                Yes! You will be doing your community a great favor by archiving your community founders'
                work. It doesn't <i>have</i> to be indexed with a GitHub Pages site - it could be a Discord
                pinned message or a Google Sheets spreadsheet, but personally I like to go all out and give
                it something dedicated. You do you. :)
            </p>

            <h1>What's with the 2010's design?</h1>
            <p>
                It just fits the bill.
            </p>
