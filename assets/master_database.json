            "description": "I started making a new mod, this time for Luxor. The idea is to mix levels from Luxor and Luxor Amun Rising (there will be some path alterations as well), generally, trying to make out the best of Luxor gameplay. There will be a total of 21 stages, each stage has 5 regular levels and one level with zuma-like gameplay (single long train). The mod comes before Luxor Mod 2016.",

            "description": "There was once a rooster called Pekka who lived in Finland and whose job was to take care of chickens in his henhouse. And this is what he was doing every day. Well, maybe except if someone (hmm, I wonder who) kidnapped all the hens and Pekka had to rescue them! This didn't just happen once, but with the help of the brave rooster, the chickens always were home and dry after all. And so, for his great skills and dedication to the hens (and the whole world) Pekka has been awarden The Silver AppleÂ®. This was really something for a farm bird like Pekka. But for a time...\n\nThe Apple Pursuit is Bobik's third episode for Pekka Kana 2. The episode consists of 30 levels, among which you'll find three boss battles and three bonus rounds. I had spent quite a lot of time making this episode and I hope you enjoy playing it. The levels are kinda tricky but it is 100% possible to beat them all - all you need is the skill! What you'll also find here are many custom made resources. You may freely distribute all music modules, graphics and sprites from this package on the Internet (just remember to credit their proper creators). The episode should be played at 640x480 (the smallest) resolution and was tested with version 1.21 of Pekka Kana 2. Before playing, choose the language file included in this archive \"- The Apple Pursuit -.txt\".",
            "notes": "The version linked below should have Riddle of the Sphinx already fixed; there were multiple bugs in the level. When in doubt, download the level fix below, labelled \"Riddle of the Sphinx Fix\".",
